# 🚀 Flutter Mini Projects Collection Flutter Mini Projects Collection is a structured set of independent Flutter applications built to strengthen practical mobile app development skills. The repository combines authentication systems, local and cloud database integration, state management, and adaptive theme handling into modular mini projects. All applications were developed using **Visual Studio Code** and tested on **Android Emulators**. --- ## ✨ Projects Included ### 📝 Notes App A local notes management application built with: - Isar (Local NoSQL Database) - Provider (State Management) - Code generation using build_runner - Full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) **Focus Areas** - Local persistent storage - Reactive UI updates using Provider - Clean and structured architecture --- ### 🛍️ E-Commerce App A product-based UI application demonstrating: - Provider for state management - Organized widget structure - Asset-based product images - Scrollable layouts and clean UI composition **Focus Areas** - State-driven UI rendering - Modular folder organization - Flutter layout building --- ### 🗄️ Firebase Database Project A cloud-integrated Flutter application using: - Firebase Core - Cloud Firestore **Focus Areas** - Cloud data storage - Firestore document handling - Backend integration with Flutter --- ### 🔐 Authentication Module An authentication-focused Flutter project implementing: - Firebase Authentication - Email & Password login - Google Sign-In integration - Firebase backend configuration **Focus Areas** - Secure authentication flow - Third-party authentication integration - Navigation handling after login --- ### 🌗 Light & Dark Mode Implementation A theme-focused project demonstrating: - Manual in-app theme switching - Automatic system theme detection - Adaptive UI behavior based on device settings **Focus Areas** - ThemeMode handling - Improved user experience - UI adaptability --- ## 🛠 Tech Stack - Flutter (SDK 3.x) - Dart - Provider - Isar Database - Firebase Core - Cloud Firestore - Firebase Authentication - Google Sign-In - Visual Studio Code - Android Emulator --- ## 💻 Development Environment - IDE: Visual Studio Code - Emulator: Android Emulator - Platform Tested: Android - Version Control: Git & GitHub --- ## 📂 Repository Structure
